  	<h1>Michael Gutleber</h1>
    <p>I am a lifelong New Yorker who enjoys learning new computer technologies and applying them to solve peopleâ€™s needs. I am passionate about programming and enjoy completing challenging projects. My creativity allows me to come up with efficient solutions to problems and my attention to detail allows me to write computer code accurately. I work well with others and am considerate of their needs and abilities in forming an effective team. My 15 years of computer programming experience, my computer science BA and my web developer immersive certification give me a solid foundation from which to grow.</p>
