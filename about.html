      <h2 class="about-h2">Michael Gutleber</h2>
      <p class="about-text1">I am a lifelong New Yorker who enjoys learning new computer technologies and applying them to solve people’s needs. I am passionate about computers and like completing challenging projects. My creativity allows me to come up with efficient solutions to problems and my attention to detail helps me create accurate code. I am considerate of people’s needs and abilities when working with others.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text2">I am intelligent and understand new things well. I am resourceful and am able to learn independently from professional web sites such as stackoverflow.com and MDN. I have 15 years of computer programming experience working mostly for top banks where I learned to read other people’s code and understand and maintain it. I recently completed web development training at General Assembly where I learned many of the current technologies including JavaScript, React, Express, and Rails.
