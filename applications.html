      <a href="http://fast-badlands-99781.herokuapp.com/">The New York Times Article Search Application  </a>
      will allow a user to search the New York Times article database by keyword and will
      retrieve the most relevant 3-10 articles. It also allows for the retrieval of 3-10 recent articles
      from the New York Times based on their section. The results are links to the New York Times web site.
      These URLs may be saved. A user can also save up to four topics, which will
      then be displayed along with the query results whenever they log in. This was developed using React and
      Rails.

      allows a user to create flashcards grouped by subject. The user has the option of typing in the definition of a flashcard term
      or retrieving a definition from the Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary and editing that. Cards can be placed into 2
      categories, those that need more studying, the default, and those that have been memorized. This was
      developed by a team of 3 developers using React and Express.
