      <a href="http://fast-badlands-99781.herokuapp.com/">The New York Times Article Search Application  </a>
      will allow a user to search the New York Times article database by keyword and will
      retrieve the most relevant 3-10 articles. It also allows for the retrieval of 3-10 recent articles
      from the New York Times based on their section. The results are links to the New York Times web site.
      These Urls may be saved if the user registers. A registered user can also save up to four topics, which will
      then be displayed along with the query results whenever they log in. This was developed using React and
      Rails.

      <a href="https://infinite-eyrie-11286.herokuapp.com/">Medi-Flash  </a>
      allows a user to create flashcards grouped by subject. The user has the option of typing in the definition of a flashcard term
      or retrieving a definition from the Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary and editing that. Cards can be placed into 2
      categories, those that need more studying, the default, and those that have been memorized. This was
      developed by a team of 3 developers using React and Express.
